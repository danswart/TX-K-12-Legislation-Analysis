## Opinionated Executive Summary:  Good Intentions, Unintended Results

The teacher incentive programs in Article 1 sound good at first, but they end up creating several big problems that make education worse. These problems are shown in the "Table of Codes for Bad Results We Will Actually Get" below.

#### The Master Teacher Money Problem:

The program promises to reward the best teachers with bonuses ranging from $12,000 to $36,000. But these bonuses will, in the long run, make teachers care more about money than actually teaching (Code A shows up in 89% of the incentives). Instead of focusing on teaching, teachers will naturally start acting for the money, which hurts the students who need great teaching the most.

#### The Performance Pay Trick:

Performance pay systems try to reward good teachers by giving them different pay scales. But in this case they end up making standardized tests and rankings more important than fixing the real problems that teachers face.  They are extrinsic motivators.  This causes districts to waste huge amounts of money on rankings, while the systemic problems stay the same.

#### The Teamwork Destroyer:

Teacher incentive programs claim to improve teaching by offering rewards, but they actually make teachers compete against each other for a small amount of money (Code B appears in 64% of the incentives). Instead of working together to improve education, teachers are forced to compete, which destroys teamwork, something schools really need.

#### The Local Control Takeover:

While these programs seem to support local school innovation, 57% of them actually take away control from local districts (Code F). They force districts to follow state-designed evaluation systems, teacher placement rules, and standard performance measures, leaving communities with little say in their own education decisions.

#### The Small District Trap:

Bonuses meant to help small, poor districts keep experienced teachers ($5,000-$10,000) actually will likely end up creating even bigger problems. These policies increase state dependency (Code C), add administrative burdens (Code E), and reduce flexibility (Code F). Small districts may end up spending more on compliance than they actually get in incentive funding.

#### The Blame Game Problem:

Programs that aim to improve education by tough teacher evaluations and strategic teacher placement end up blaming teachers for problems instead of fixing the systems that cause them (Code G appears in 50% of the incentives). This policy aims to 'fix' individual teachers rather than addressing the bigger issues created by the system in which they work.

#### The Professional Growth Killer:

Programs that encourage National Board Certification and professional development seem to help teachers grow professionally.  But, no amount of certification can overcome the limitations placed on districts by central planning from Austin (Code A shows up here).

#### Summary

These problems shows legislation that cannot actually improve education. Instead, it’s focused on control mechanisms disguised as teacher support. The policies are like training animals with rewards and punishments. They assume teachers care only about money, not the real purpose of teaching.

In the end, these policies hurt motivation, teamwork, and the systems that actually help students learn. They also create financial obligations and red tape that force districts to beg for money every couple of years. This ultimately harms everyone, especially the students these policies claim to help.

### Key to List of Likely Negative Results 

#### The evaluation codes are based on these axioms:

- Central planning (one size fits all) degrades everyone's performance
  - Makes nearly every district action a legal matter
  - Robs people of pride in their work
  
- Efforts at 'accountability' will not improve performance of anyone

- Cooperation within an organization is far more effective than competition 

- All incentives work; some promote and some pervert the ***intention*** of the incentive
