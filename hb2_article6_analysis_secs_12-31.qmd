## Opinionated Executive Summary: Testing Replaces Teaching, Data Replaces Education

This law transforms Texas public education into a test-driven, data-obsessed system that measures everything except actual learning. Here are the main unintended results:


#### Education Becomes About Numbers, Not Learning

The new accountability system adds more ways to measure schools but fails to focus on what really matters: student learning. Some schools will be forced to focus on numbers that improve their ratings rather than improving education itself.


#### Exchanging Liberty for Industry Certifications Mandates

The state now has a list of "approved" industry certifications that count for accountability. This turns schools into places where students collect certificates, rather than places where they build real skills and knowledge.  


#### Funding Depends on Following Rules, Not Education

Schools now have to meet state-defined goals and use state-approved programs to get funding. This forces schools to choose between teaching students and getting the money they need.


#### Data Collection Takes Over

Schools must track graduates for years, collect information about their jobs, and report their wages. Schools become data collection centers instead of places where students learn.  This is an outrageous requirement.  Only an 'intellectual' could come up with it.


#### Competition Replaces Working Together

Limited funding forces people to compete with each other for resources. This stops them from working together; cooperation to improve the system of learning.  It artificially creates winners and losers.


#### The Biggest Problem: Measuring Over Improving

These rules create a system that focuses on measuring things rather than improving them. The state decides what gets measured, how it's measured, and what counts as success. Local communities lose the ability to decide what makes education good for their own children.

### Key List of Likely Negative Results 

#### The evaluation codes are based on these axioms:

- Central planning (one size fits all) degrades everyone's performance
  - Makes nearly every district action a legal matter
  - Robs people of pride in their work
  
- Efforts at 'accountability' will not improve performance of anyone

- Cooperation within an organization is far more effective than competition 

- All incentives work; some promote and some pervert the ***intention*** of the incentive
