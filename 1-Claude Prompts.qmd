# DAG ANALYSIS WITH SYNTHETIC DATA

## FIRST SUBMIT THE DAG ANALYSIS TEMPLATE CODE:

I will first transmit to you a fully operational DAG-analysis-with-synthetic-data-and-simpsons code to use as a TEMPLATE for my preferences for section headings, style, formatting and color as you process the new DAG.  I will submit to you the conceptional DAG code in the subsequent prompt.   It is not required that you mimic the template code precisely. You may need to alter it based on the structural characteristics of the new DAG analysis under consideration. 

I'm uploading this fully functional code to you BEFORE uploading the conceptual DAG code (to be actualized with the synthetic data you produce). Here's the TEMPLATE to keep in your memory as you process the upcoming conceptual DAG code.  Please follow and include ALL the items in the TEMPLATE because it contains items that may NOT already exist in the conceptual code.  Here it is:     



## SECOND SUBMIT THE CONCEPTIONAL DAG CODE:

Here is the conceptual DAG code.  Provide new code to analyze the conceptual DAG using synthetic data that you generate appropriate for the DAG under consideration.  Rules for composition of new code:


1. For DAG visualizations, use clean variable names without the descriptive labels '(Root Cause)'.  'Collider' or '(Confounder)' are fine.
2. ALWAYS use the DT() package, not the kable/kableExtra packages.
3. IF YOU PAUSE, ALWAYS "CONTINUE FROM ENDPOINT"
4. Check the current ending point of the artifact
5. Add only new content from that exact point forward
6. Never repeat any existing sections, code chunks, or YAML headers
7. Maintain unique chunk labels for any new code blocks
8. Keep the same document structure and styling
9. I expect a long, continuous Quarto document suitable for me to copy and paste into a new Quarto document
10. Maintain the same styling, color and theme in the new code as found in the template code
11. ALWAYS round to 3 decimal places, NOT 4.
12. Copy the YAML verbatim from the template with the exception of the title:  parameter.  That should reflect the new code matter.
13. For code structure and sequence, Follow the template exactly
14. Copy the DiagrammeR code precisely with regard to font family, font size, node colors, and node positions.  
15. Include an analysis to determine if Simpson's Paradox is evident in the data

3. IF YOU PAUSE, ALWAYS "CONTINUE FROM ENDPOINT"
4. Check the current ending point of the artifact
5. Add only new content from that exact point forward
6. Never repeat any existing sections, code chunks, or YAML headers
7. Maintain unique chunk labels for any new code blocks
8. Keep the same document structure and styling

DO NOT REPEAT CONTENT IN THE ARTIFACT!

Here is the new DAG conceptual code:     





# LEGISLATIVE CODE ANALYSIS 

## FIRST PROMPT - TEMPLATE CODE FOR ANALYZING LEGISLATION:


I am transmitting to you a fully operational TEMPLATE for building out tables based on your upcoming analysis of the legislative code sections that will come to you in the next prompt.  Use this a template for building out the tables for a new Quarto document based on the sections of legislation I will transmit in the next prompt.



I'm uploading this fully functional code to you BEFORE uploading the legislative code sections to be analyzed. 

Here's the TEMPLATE to keep in your memory as you process the legislative code sections that follow:  

DO NOTHING UNTIL YOU RECEIVE MY NEXT PROMPT



## SECOND SUBMIT PDF OF LEGISLATIVE CODE SECTIONS TO BE ANALYSED:


THERE ARE A LOT OF INSTRUCTIONS HERE SO READ THEM CAREFULLY

ANALYZE ONLY Article 6 (Sections 6.12 - 6.31). 
STOP ANALYSIS AT Article 7, Section 7.01. 
EXCLUDE Section 7.01 and all subsequent content.
Document this scope in the YAML description field.


Rules for composition of new code:

Follow the template EXACTLY but substitute the new information you glean from the attached pdf file.  

Pay attention to my preferences for categories, section headings, style, formatting and color as you process the new tables. 

Populate columns 1, 2, 3 AND 4 of the new MAIN TABLE based on your careful and thoughtful analysis of the pdf document. 

CREATE ALL THE SUPPLEMENTAL TABLES AS WELL.

ADD SECTION AT THE END NAMED "INTERESTING..." AND INCLUDE IN THAT SECTION (IN A VERY BRIEF WAY) ANY IRONIC OR COUNTER-INTUTIVE IMPLICATIONS OF THE LEGISLATIVE CODE YOU JUST ANALYZED - THIS IS SECTION IS NEW FOR THIS CYCLE OF TABLES.


1. ALWAYS use the DT() package, not the kable/kableExtra packages.
2. WHEN YOU PAUSE, ALWAYS "CONTINUE FROM ENDPOINT"
3. Check the current ending point of the artifact
4. Add only new content from that exact point forward
5. Never repeat any existing sections, code chunks, or YAML headers
6. Maintain unique chunk labels for any new code blocks
7. Keep the same document structure and styling
8. I expect a long, continuous Quarto document suitable for me to copy and paste into a new Quarto document
9. Maintain the same styling, color and theme in the new code as found in the template code
10. ALWAYS round to 3 decimal places, NOT 4.
11. Copy the YAML verbatim from the template with the exception of the "title" parameter.  That should reflect the the new code matter you analyze.
12. For code structure and sequence, Follow the template exactly

13. USE YOUR VERY BEST JUDGEMENT WHEN ANALYZING THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT.


DO NOT REPEAT CONTENT IN THE ARTIFACT!

THERE IS NO SUMMARIZATION AT THE END.  IT IS AT THE BEGINNING.

Watch out for unexpected string constants

put in code to verify that there's a match in the number of rows between the different columns in the data frame. Make the code a generic check so the same code will work with all future jobs no matter how many rows are generated.  Ensure all pertinent vectors have exactly the same length.

Here is the pdf file with the legislative code for analysis. 











# EXECUTIVE SUMMARIES FOR EARLIER FILES

## FIRST PROMPT:


Our earlier legislative code analysis did not contain an Executive Summary section where you put your opinions of the ironic or counter-intuitive aspects of the legislative code sections we analyzed.  

Here is a NEW, REVISED TEMPLATE for constructing the rmarkdown code that I can add to my existing QUARTO document.

DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL YOU GET MY NEXT PROMPT, which will contain the rmarkdown code we arrived at in our analysis of Article 4 of the legislative code.  Here's the TEMPLATE:   




## SECOND PROMPT:


Here is the relevant Quarto content for you to analyze and then create the brief executive summary.  

DO NOT INCLUDE A YAML OR LOAD ANY LIBRARIES.  

INCLUDE ALL RMARKDOWN SYNTAX AND FORMATTING.

DO NOT COPY ANY CODE WHATSOEVER FROM THE CONTENT PROVIDED.

I will be cutting and pasting this new code into my existing Quarto documents.






# REVISING OLD CODE WITH NEW EVALUATION CODES

## FIRST PROMPT - UPDATE SECTIONS COVERED



Here's the complete analysis code I created for

Article 5, Secs 17-29

with my old 14-code system.


The new evaluation codes are based on these axioms:

Axioms:

- Central planning (one size fits all) degrades everyone's - performance
- Makes nearly every district action a legal matter.
- Robs people of taking pride in their work.
- Efforts at 'accountability' will not improve performance of anyone.
- Cooperation within an organization is far more effective than competition 
- All incentives work; some promote and some pervert the intention of the incentive


DON'T DO ANYTHING UNTIL YOU GET MY NEXT PROMPT




## SECOND PROMPT


THERE ARE A LOT OF INSTRUCTIONS HERE SO READ CAREFULLY!

A. Decreases intrinsic motivation in favor of extrinsic motivation
B. Decreases cooperation within districts in favor of competition for resources
C. Increases dependency on State funding and bureaucracy
D. Substitutes 'accountability' for improvement of the system people work in
E. Increases district administrative burdens
F. Decreases local control and flexibility
G. Treats people as the 'problem', instead of the system they work in


Re-evaluate each section and replace Column 4 with new codes.


For each section, ask: Does this provision...
- Code A: Decrease intrinsic motivation in favor of extrinsic?
- Code B: Decrease cooperation in favor of competition for resources?
- Code C. Increases dependency on State funding and bureaucracy?
- Code D. Substitute 'accountability' for improvement of the system people work in?
- Code E. Increases district administrative burdens?
- Code F. Decreases local control and flexibility?
- Code G. Treat people as the 'problem', instead of the system they work in?


Keep all existing analysis in Columns 1-3, only update the codes in Column 4.

Update the Supplemental Tables accordingly.

When updating the section named 'Opinionated Executive Summary and Counter-Intuitive Implications' KEEP THE TEXT AT THE FLESCH-KINCADE READING LEVLE OF 9th-10th GRADE LEVEL.


1. IF YOU PAUSE, ALWAYS "CONTINUE FROM ENDPOINT"
2. Check the current ending point of the artifact
4. Add only new content from that exact point forward
5. Never repeat any existing sections, code chunks, or YAML headers
6. Maintain unique chunk labels for any new code blocks
7. Keep the same document structure and styling
8. I expect a long, continuous Quarto document suitable for me to copy and paste into a new Quarto document
9. Maintain the same styling, color and theme in the new code as found in the template code
10. ALWAYS round to 3 decimal places, NOT 4.
11. Copy the YAML verbatim from the template with the exception of the "title" parameter.  That should reflect the the new code matter you analyze.
12. For code structure and sequence, Follow the template exactly

13. USE YOUR VERY BEST JUDGEMENT WHEN ANALYZING THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT.


IF YOU PAUSE, DO NOT REPEAT ANY CONTENT IN THE ARTIFACT!

Watch out for unexpected string constants

Include code to verify that there's a match in the number of rows between the different columns in the data frames so the Tables will come out right. Make that code a generic check so the same checking code will work with all future jobs no matter how many rows are generated.  Ensure all pertinent vectors have exactly the same length.

The text of the 'Opinionated Executive Summary' must be KEPT AT FLEISCH-KINKADE 9TH GRADE LEVEL.
