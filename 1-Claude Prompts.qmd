# CONCEPTUAL DAG CODE TO ANALYSIS WITH SYNTHETIC DATA

## FIRST SUBMIT THE DAG ANALYSIS TEMPLATE CODE:

I will first transmit to you a fully operational DAG-analysis-with-synthetic-data-and-simpsons code to use as a TEMPLATE for my preferences for section headings, style, formatting and color as you process the new DAG.  I will submit to you the conceptional DAG code in the subsequent prompt.   It is not required that you mimic the template code precisely. You may need to alter it based on the structural characteristics of the new DAG analysis under consideration. 

I'm uploading this fully functional code to you BEFORE uploading the conceptual DAG code (to be actualized with the synthetic data you produce). Here's the TEMPLATE to keep in your memory as you process the upcoming conceptual DAG code.  Please follow and include ALL the items in the TEMPLATE because it contains items that may NOT already exist in the conceptual code.  Here it is:     



## SECOND SUBMIT THE CONCEPTIONAL DAG CODE:

Here is the conceptual DAG code.  Provide new code to analyze the conceptual DAG using synthetic data that you generate appropriate for the DAG under consideration.  Rules for composition of new code:


1. For DAG visualizations, use clean variable names without the descriptive labels '(Root Cause)'.  'Collider' or '(Confounder)' are fine.
2. ALWAYS use the DT() package, not the kable/kableExtra packages.
3. IF YOU PAUSE, ALWAYS "CONTINUE FROM ENDPOINT"
4. Check the current ending point of the artifact
5. Add only new content from that exact point forward
6. Never repeat any existing sections, code chunks, or YAML headers
7. Maintain unique chunk labels for any new code blocks
8. Keep the same document structure and styling
9. I expect a long, continuous Quarto document suitable for me to copy and paste into a new Quarto document
10. Maintain the same styling, color and theme in the new code as found in the template code
11. ALWAYS round to 3 decimal places, NOT 4.
12. Copy the YAML verbatim from the template with the exception of the title:  parameter.  That should reflect the new code matter.
13. For code structure and sequence, Follow the template exactly
14. Copy the DiagrammeR code precisely with regard to font family, font size, node colors, and node positions.  
15. Include an analysis to determine if Simpson's Paradox is evident in the data

3. IF YOU PAUSE, ALWAYS "CONTINUE FROM ENDPOINT"
4. Check the current ending point of the artifact
5. Add only new content from that exact point forward
6. Never repeat any existing sections, code chunks, or YAML headers
7. Maintain unique chunk labels for any new code blocks
8. Keep the same document structure and styling

DO NOT REPEAT CONTENT IN THE ARTIFACT!

Here is the new DAG conceptual code:     








## ADD A SIMPSON'S PARADOX ANALYSIS TO EXISTING WORKING SYNTHETIC DATA ANALYSIS CODE

I need a new analysis section that reveals if Simpson's Paradox is present or not in the synthetic data of this existing code.  Use Quarto formatting and syntax.  DO NOT change any of the existing code - it works perfectly.  Provide Quarto code that I can copy and paste into my existing document.

Create a new Simpson's Paradox section that will go immediately before the ending section named "## Session Information for Reproducibility".

In the first prompt I will first provide you with some fully functioning code you created to use as a template for this new section.

In the subsequent prompt I will provide you with the fully functioning code of the DAG to which your new section will be added.

DO NOTHING UNTIL YOU RECEIVE THE SECOND PROMPT.

Consider including the following sections in the Simpson's Paradox section:

- Simpson's Paradox Detection Analysis
- Testing for Simpson's Paradox by Status
- Testing for Simpson's Paradox by Groups
- Visual Detection of Simpson's Paradox
- Formal Statistical Test for Simpson's Paradox
- Magnitude of Simpson's Paradox Effect
- Weighted vs Unweighted Analysis
- Conclusions from Simpson's Paradox Analysis


Rules for composition of new code:


1. For DAG visualizations, use clean variable names without the descriptive labels '(Root Cause)'.  'Collider' or '(Confounder)' are fine.
2. ALWAYS use the DT() package, not the kable/kableExtra packages.
3. IF YOU PAUSE, ALWAYS "CONTINUE FROM ENDPOINT"
4. Check the current ending point of the artifact
5. Add only new content from that exact point forward
6. Never repeat any existing sections, code chunks, or YAML headers
7. Maintain unique chunk labels for any new code blocks
8. Keep the same document structure and styling
9. I expect a long, continuous Quarto document suitable for me to copy and paste into a new Quarto document
10. Maintain the same styling, color and theme in the new code as found in the template code
11. ALWAYS round to 3 decimal places, NOT 4
12. Create plots with the ggplot2 package
13. Don't use conversational language such as "Lets do this" or "our" or "we" or "First we'll" or "Now we'll".  Instead, the commentary should simply state what is happening in that section of the analysis


Here is the fully functioning code to use as a TEMPLATE:


## 12. Simpson's Paradox Detection Analysis

Simpson's Paradox occurs when the direction of an association between two variables reverses when conditioning on a third variable. In our fork structure DAG, we can examine whether this phenomenon occurs by stratifying our data based on different levels of the confounder Z.

Think of Simpson's Paradox like a mirage in causal inference - what appears to be true at the surface level completely reverses when you look deeper. In our DAG example, we might find that overall, X appears to have one effect on Y, but within each level of the confounder Z, the relationship tells a different story.

### 12.1 Simpson's Paradox Detection Analysis

First, let's examine the overall relationship between X and Y, and then compare it to the relationship within different strata of Z:

```{r}
#| label: detect-simpsons-paradox
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Calculate overall correlation between X and Y
overall_cor <- cor(dag_data$X, dag_data$Y)
overall_slope <- coef(lm(Y ~ X, data = dag_data))[2]

# Create Z quartiles for stratified analysis
dag_data$Z_quartile <- cut(dag_data$Z, 
                          breaks = quantile(dag_data$Z, probs = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1)), 
                          labels = c("Q1 (Low)", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4 (High)"),
                          include.lowest = TRUE)

# Calculate correlations and slopes within each Z quartile
stratified_results <- dag_data %>%
  group_by(Z_quartile) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    cor_XY = cor(X, Y),
    slope_XY = coef(lm(Y ~ X))[2],
    mean_Z = mean(Z),
    mean_X = mean(X),
    mean_Y = mean(Y),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Add overall results for comparison
overall_results <- data.frame(
  Z_quartile = "Overall",
  n = nrow(dag_data),
  cor_XY = overall_cor,
  slope_XY = overall_slope,
  mean_Z = mean(dag_data$Z),
  mean_X = mean(dag_data$X),
  mean_Y = mean(dag_data$Y)
)

# Combine results
simpson_analysis <- bind_rows(overall_results, stratified_results)

# Round for display
simpson_analysis <- simpson_analysis %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., 3)))

# Display results
DT::datatable(simpson_analysis,
              caption = "Simpson's Paradox Detection: Overall vs Stratified Analysis",
              options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX = TRUE),
              colnames = c("Z Group", "N", "Correlation X-Y", "Slope X→Y", 
                          "Mean Z", "Mean X", "Mean Y")) %>%
  DT::formatRound(columns = c("cor_XY", "slope_XY", "mean_Z", "mean_X", "mean_Y"), digits = 3)
```

### 12.2 Testing for Simpson's Paradox by Status

Let's formally test whether Simpson's Paradox is present by examining if the direction of association changes:

```{r}
#| label: test-simpsons-paradox-status
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Function to determine Simpson's Paradox status
detect_simpson_status <- function(overall_slope, stratified_slopes) {
  # Check if all stratified slopes have the same sign
  stratified_signs <- sign(stratified_slopes)
  overall_sign <- sign(overall_slope)
  
  # Simpson's Paradox occurs when overall sign differs from all stratified signs
  if (all(stratified_signs == stratified_signs[1]) && 
      overall_sign != stratified_signs[1]) {
    return("Strong Simpson's Paradox")
  } else if (any(stratified_signs != overall_sign)) {
    return("Partial Simpson's Paradox")
  } else {
    return("No Simpson's Paradox")
  }
}

# Get stratified slopes (excluding overall)
stratified_slopes <- stratified_results$slope_XY

# Determine Simpson's Paradox status
simpson_status <- detect_simpson_status(overall_slope, stratified_slopes)

# Create summary table
simpson_summary <- data.frame(
  Measure = c("Overall Slope", "Mean Stratified Slope", "Range of Stratified Slopes",
              "Overall Correlation", "Mean Stratified Correlation", "Simpson's Paradox Status"),
  Value = c(
    round(overall_slope, 3),
    round(mean(stratified_slopes), 3),
    paste(round(min(stratified_slopes), 3), "to", round(max(stratified_slopes), 3)),
    round(overall_cor, 3),
    round(mean(stratified_results$cor_XY), 3),
    simpson_status
  )
)

# Display summary
DT::datatable(simpson_summary,
              caption = "Simpson's Paradox Status Summary",
              options = list(pageLength = 10, dom = 't'),
              colnames = c("Measure", "Value"))
```

### 12.3 Testing for Simpson's Paradox by Groups

Let's examine the phenomenon more systematically by creating binary high/low groups for Z:

```{r}
#| label: test-simpsons-by-groups
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Create binary Z groups (high/low based on median split)
dag_data$Z_binary <- ifelse(dag_data$Z > median(dag_data$Z), "High Z", "Low Z")

# Calculate slopes and correlations for binary groups
binary_analysis <- dag_data %>%
  group_by(Z_binary) %>%
  summarise(
    n = n(),
    cor_XY = cor(X, Y),
    slope_XY = coef(lm(Y ~ X))[2],
    intercept_XY = coef(lm(Y ~ X))[1],
    mean_Z = mean(Z),
    mean_X = mean(X),
    mean_Y = mean(Y),
    .groups = 'drop'
  )

# Add confidence intervals for slopes
binary_analysis$slope_se <- NA
binary_analysis$slope_ci_lower <- NA
binary_analysis$slope_ci_upper <- NA

for (group in unique(dag_data$Z_binary)) {
  group_data <- dag_data[dag_data$Z_binary == group, ]
  model <- lm(Y ~ X, data = group_data)
  slope_se <- summary(model)$coefficients["X", "Std. Error"]
  slope_ci <- confint(model)["X", ]
  
  binary_analysis[binary_analysis$Z_binary == group, "slope_se"] <- slope_se
  binary_analysis[binary_analysis$Z_binary == group, "slope_ci_lower"] <- slope_ci[1]
  binary_analysis[binary_analysis$Z_binary == group, "slope_ci_upper"] <- slope_ci[2]
}

# Round for display
binary_analysis <- binary_analysis %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), ~ round(., 3)))

# Display binary group analysis
DT::datatable(binary_analysis,
              caption = "Binary Group Analysis for Simpson's Paradox Detection",
              options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX = TRUE),
              colnames = c("Z Group", "N", "Correlation", "Slope", "Intercept", 
                          "Mean Z", "Mean X", "Mean Y", "Slope SE", "CI Lower", "CI Upper")) %>%
  DT::formatRound(columns = c("cor_XY", "slope_XY", "intercept_XY", "mean_Z", 
                              "mean_X", "mean_Y", "slope_se", "slope_ci_lower", "slope_ci_upper"), 
                  digits = 3)
```

### 12.4 Visual Detection of Simpson's Paradox

Let's create visualizations to clearly demonstrate whether Simpson's Paradox is present in our data:

```{r}
#| label: visualize-simpsons-paradox
#| fig-cap: "Visual Detection of Simpson's Paradox"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "Overall relationship vs stratified relationships (quartiles)"
#|   - "Binary group analysis with separate regression lines"
#|   - "Slope comparison across different Z stratifications"
#| layout-ncol: 1

# Plot 1: Overall vs Stratified (Quartiles)
p1 <- ggplot(dag_data, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +
  # Overall regression line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, color = "red", linewidth = 1.5, 
              linetype = "dashed", se = FALSE) +
  # Stratified regression lines
  geom_smooth(aes(color = Z_quartile), method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, 
              linewidth = 1, se = FALSE) +
  # Points colored by quartile
  geom_point(aes(color = Z_quartile), alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_color_viridis_d(name = "Z Quartile") +
  labs(
    title = "Simpson's Paradox Analysis: Overall vs Stratified Relationships",
    subtitle = paste("Overall slope (red dashed):", round(overall_slope, 3),
                    "| Simpson's Status:", simpson_status),
    x = "X (Exposure)",
    y = "Y (Outcome)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Plot 2: Binary Group Analysis
p2 <- ggplot(dag_data, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +
  # Overall regression line
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, color = "red", linewidth = 1.5, 
              linetype = "dashed", se = FALSE) +
  # Stratified regression lines for binary groups
  geom_smooth(aes(color = Z_binary), method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, 
              linewidth = 1.2, se = TRUE, alpha = 0.3) +
  # Points colored by binary group
  geom_point(aes(color = Z_binary), alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("High Z" = "darkblue", "Low Z" = "darkgreen"),
                     name = "Z Group") +
  labs(
    title = "Binary Group Analysis for Simpson's Paradox",
    subtitle = "Red dashed line: Overall relationship | Colored lines: Group-specific relationships",
    x = "X (Exposure)",
    y = "Y (Outcome)"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

# Plot 3: Slope Comparison
slope_comparison <- data.frame(
  Group = c("Overall", stratified_results$Z_quartile, binary_analysis$Z_binary),
  Slope = c(overall_slope, stratified_results$slope_XY, binary_analysis$slope_XY),
  Type = c("Overall", rep("Quartile", 4), rep("Binary", 2))
)

p3 <- ggplot(slope_comparison, aes(x = reorder(Group, Slope), y = Slope, fill = Type)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "black") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.4, linetype = "dotted", color = "red", alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Overall" = "red", "Quartile" = "steelblue", "Binary" = "darkgreen")) +
  labs(
    title = "Slope Comparison Across Different Stratifications",
    subtitle = "Red dotted line shows true causal effect (0.4)",
    x = "Group",
    y = "Slope of X → Y"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))

```

### 12.5 Formal Statistical Test for Simpson's Paradox

Let's conduct formal statistical tests to quantify the evidence for Simpson's Paradox:

```{r}
#| label: formal-test-simpsons-paradox
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Function to test for significant differences in slopes
test_slope_differences <- function(overall_slope, overall_se, stratified_slopes, stratified_ses) {
  # Test if overall slope differs significantly from each stratified slope
  z_stats <- (overall_slope - stratified_slopes) / sqrt(overall_se^2 + stratified_ses^2)
  p_values <- 2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(z_stats)))
  
  return(list(z_stats = z_stats, p_values = p_values))
}

# Get standard errors for slopes
overall_model <- lm(Y ~ X, data = dag_data)
overall_se <- summary(overall_model)$coefficients["X", "Std. Error"]

# Get standard errors for stratified models
stratified_ses <- numeric(length(stratified_slopes))
for (i in 1:length(unique(dag_data$Z_quartile))) {
  quartile <- levels(dag_data$Z_quartile)[i]
  quartile_data <- dag_data[dag_data$Z_quartile == quartile, ]
  model <- lm(Y ~ X, data = quartile_data)
  stratified_ses[i] <- summary(model)$coefficients["X", "Std. Error"]
}

# Perform tests
slope_tests <- test_slope_differences(overall_slope, overall_se, stratified_slopes, stratified_ses)

# Create test results table
test_results <- data.frame(
  Comparison = paste("Overall vs", stratified_results$Z_quartile),
  Overall_Slope = rep(round(overall_slope, 3), length(stratified_slopes)),
  Stratified_Slope = round(stratified_slopes, 3),
  Difference = round(overall_slope - stratified_slopes, 3),
  Z_Statistic = round(slope_tests$z_stats, 3),
  P_Value = round(slope_tests$p_values, 3),
  Significant = ifelse(slope_tests$p_values < 0.05, "Yes", "No")
)

# Display test results
DT::datatable(test_results,
              caption = "Formal Statistical Tests for Slope Differences",
              options = list(pageLength = 10, scrollX = TRUE)) %>%
  DT::formatRound(columns = c("Overall_Slope", "Stratified_Slope", "Difference", 
                              "Z_Statistic", "P_Value"), digits = 3)
```

### 12.6 Magnitude of Simpson's Paradox Effect

Let's quantify the magnitude of the Simpson's Paradox effect if it exists:

```{r}
#| label: magnitude-simpsons-effect
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Calculate Simpson's Paradox magnitude measures
simpson_magnitude <- data.frame(
  Measure = c(
    "Overall Slope",
    "Average Stratified Slope",
    "Absolute Difference",
    "Relative Difference (%)",
    "Direction Reversal",
    "Weighted Average Slope",
    "Simpson's Paradox Strength"
  ),
  Value = c(
    round(overall_slope, 3),
    round(mean(stratified_slopes), 3),
    round(abs(overall_slope - mean(stratified_slopes)), 3),
    round(100 * abs(overall_slope - mean(stratified_slopes)) / abs(mean(stratified_slopes)), 3),
    ifelse(sign(overall_slope) != sign(mean(stratified_slopes)), "Yes", "No"),
    # Weighted average by group size
    round(sum(stratified_results$slope_XY * stratified_results$n) / sum(stratified_results$n), 3),
    # Simpson's strength: how much the overall deviates from weighted average
    round(abs(overall_slope - sum(stratified_results$slope_XY * stratified_results$n) / sum(stratified_results$n)), 3)
  )
)

# Display magnitude analysis
DT::datatable(simpson_magnitude,
              caption = "Magnitude of Simpson's Paradox Effect",
              options = list(pageLength = 10, dom = 't'),
              colnames = c("Measure", "Value"))
```

### 12.7 Weighted vs Unweighted Analysis

Let's compare weighted and unweighted analyses to understand the role of group sizes:

```{r}
#| label: weighted-unweighted-analysis
#| message: false
#| warning: false

# Calculate weighted statistics
weighted_slope <- sum(stratified_results$slope_XY * stratified_results$n) / sum(stratified_results$n)
weighted_cor <- sum(stratified_results$cor_XY * stratified_results$n) / sum(stratified_results$n)

# Calculate unweighted statistics
unweighted_slope <- mean(stratified_results$slope_XY)
unweighted_cor <- mean(stratified_results$cor_XY)

# Group size analysis
group_size_analysis <- stratified_results %>%
  mutate(
    prop_of_total = round(n / sum(n), 3),
    slope_weight = round(slope_XY * prop_of_total, 3),
    cor_weight = round(cor_XY * prop_of_total, 3)
  ) %>%
  select(Z_quartile, n, prop_of_total, slope_XY, slope_weight, cor_XY, cor_weight)

# Add summary row
summary_row <- data.frame(
  Z_quartile = "Weighted Total",
  n = sum(group_size_analysis$n),
  prop_of_total = 1.000,
  slope_XY = round(weighted_slope, 3),
  slope_weight = round(sum(group_size_analysis$slope_weight), 3),
  cor_XY = round(weighted_cor, 3),
  cor_weight = round(sum(group_size_analysis$cor_weight), 3)
)

group_analysis_complete <- bind_rows(group_size_analysis, summary_row)

# Display weighted analysis
DT::datatable(group_analysis_complete,
              caption = "Weighted vs Unweighted Analysis by Group Size",

              colnames = c("Z Group", "N", "Proportion", "Slope", "Weighted Slope", 
                          "Correlation", "Weighted Correlation")) %>%
  DT::formatRound(columns = c("prop_of_total", "slope_XY", "slope_weight", 
                              "cor_XY", "cor_weight"), digits = 3)

# Summary comparison table
weighting_comparison <- data.frame(
  Analysis_Type = c("Overall (Marginal)", "Unweighted Average", "Weighted Average", 
                   "True Causal Effect"),
  Slope = c(round(overall_slope, 3), round(unweighted_slope, 3), 
           round(weighted_slope, 3), 0.400),
  Correlation = c(round(overall_cor, 3), round(unweighted_cor, 3), 
                 round(weighted_cor, 3), NA)
)

              colnames = c("Analysis Type", "Slope Estimate", "Correlation"))
```

### 12.8 Conclusions from Simpson's Paradox Analysis

Based on our comprehensive analysis, here are the summarized findings about Simpson's Paradox in this synthetic dataset:

```{r}
#| label: simpsons-conclusions

Our Simpson's Paradox analysis reveals important insights about the nature of confounding in causal inference. In this synthetic dataset, we observe **`r simpson_status`**, which demonstrates how the confounder Z creates different patterns when we examine the marginal (overall) versus conditional (stratified) relationships between X and Y.

The key insight is that Simpson's Paradox is not just a statistical curiosity—it's a fundamental illustration of why proper causal analysis requires careful consideration of confounding variables. In our fork structure DAG, the confounder Z affects both the exposure X and outcome Y, creating spurious associations that can mislead us about the true causal relationship.

Think of it this way: if we only looked at the overall relationship between X and Y, we might reach one conclusion. But when we properly account for Z by examining the relationship within Z groups, we see the true causal story. This is why randomized controlled trials—which balance confounders across treatment groups—are so valuable for causal inference.

The magnitude of the Simpson's Paradox effect in our data (**`r paste(round(relative_magnitude, 1), "%")`** relative difference) underscores the practical importance of identifying and controlling for key confounders in observational studies. This analysis reinforces our earlier findings about the critical role of proper adjustment in causal inference.
