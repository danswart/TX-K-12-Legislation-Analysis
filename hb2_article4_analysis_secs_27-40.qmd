## Opinionated Executive Summary: Good Intentions, Unintended Results

The policies in Article 4, which focus on parent-directed services and dyslexia training, seem helpful but actually give more power to the state. These policies are labeled as "parental choice" and "specialized support," but they end up increasing state control while taking away local decision-making. All the policies are analyzed using a framework to detect likely consequences not intended by the legislature, showing how they will cause harm.

Not surprisingly, all the policies in these sections increase state dependency (Code C) and reduce local control (Code F). This means that every policy takes power away from local districts and puts it into the hands of state bureaucrats.


### The Parent Choice Switcher-Roo

Parent-Directed Services Programs promise to give parents more control with state-funded accounts for services, flexible provider choices, and protections for religious freedom. However, these programs make parents more dependent on the state (Code C in 100% of cases) and reduce their independence. 

It’s like saying, "You can pick any car you want, but only if you get permission from us first and choose from our approved list." Parents end up with less choice because they have to follow state rules to get the money that should be theirs.


### Provider Freedom Means Getting To Chose, but the State Controls the Options

The Provider and Vendor Criteria claim to protect religious freedom and independence by allowing parents to choose their own providers. But these policies actually decrease local control (Code F in 100% of cases) by forcing family-provider relationships into state-approved networks.

Parents who have spent years building trust with their therapists or tutors will lose those relationships when providers can't or won't meet state requirements. It’s like needing a government license for babysitters — it harms the natural relationships that actually work.


### The Dyslexia Training Trap

The Dyslexia Teacher Training Grant Program promises $350 million for better teacher training. But this program has the worst issues, including reduced motivation (Code A), more competition (Code B), and massive paperwork (Code E in 100% of cases).

Instead of improving reading instruction, this creates yet another training industry that makes money off teacher certification requirements, but the money never reaches classrooms. Teachers end up competing for grants instead of working together to help kids learn to read.


### The Central Planning Approach to Support

The Grant Program Implementation aims to help districts that don’t have enough dyslexia resources by providing panels and evidence-based design. But these policies force students into one-size-fits-all programs instead of offering personalized approaches (Code G and Code C).

Ironically, the policies that claim to build local resources actually remove the local flexibility needed for timely interventions that match each child's unique needs.


### The Religious Liberty Lawyers Relief Act

The Participant Autonomy Protections promise to protect religious freedom with non-interference language and burden-of-proof rules. But these protections come with huge administrative burdens (Code E in 100% of cases), which hurt families more than help them.

Instead of protecting religious freedom, these policies create a system where families need lawyers to exercise their rights. It’s like needing a law degree just to go to church.


### The Loss of Parental Control

The Final Determination Authority promises to make program decisions faster by giving the state commissioner the final say, eliminating the appeals process. But this means parents lose their ability to disagree with state decisions (Code F in 100% of cases).  This is a terrible thing.

Parents who have worked with schools to support their children’s needs will now have to follow state-run systems with no way to appeal poor decisions. It’s like needing federal approval for every family choice with no chance to say no.


### Information Overload

The IEP Committee Information Requirements promise to give parents full details about services and accounts. But these requirements just create more paperwork (Code E in 100% of cases), making the process about forms instead of relationships.

It’s like requiring parents to read a manual before they can talk to teachers. These policies assume that families need more rules instead of building relationships with knowledgeable professionals.


### Conclusion

These policies show a shift from family independence to centralized state control. They take away the flexibility, strong relationships, and individualized programs that are key to effective special education.

It’s like trying to improve family meals by requiring the state to approve every recipe. These policies assume that students with disabilities are better served by state regulations than by knowledgeable families working with trusted providers.

In the end, these policies undermine local decision-making and create a costly system that benefits consultants and administrators, not students. They cost millions in state funding while helping few students. The real winners are the state bureaucrats who profit from the system, not the families or children who need real support.

### Key List of Likely Negative Results

#### The evaluation codes are based on these axioms:

- Central planning (one size fits all) degrades everyone's performance
  - Makes nearly every district action a legal matter
  - Robs people of pride in their work
  
- Efforts at 'accountability' will not improve performance of anyone

- Cooperation within an organization is far more effective than competition 

- All incentives work; some promote and some pervert the ***intention*** of the incentive
