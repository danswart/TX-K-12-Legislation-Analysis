## Opinionated Executive Summary:  Good Intentions, Unintended Results

This law about early childhood education creates several problems that hurt what it tries to improve. Here are the main issues:

#### The Charter School Problem

Charter schools were meant to be different from regular public schools, giving parents more choices. But this law makes charter schools follow the same rules as regular schools. Now, parents only have the option to choose between schools that all do the same things. The idea of "choice" becomes meaningless.

#### The Money Issue for Teachers

The law offers teachers extra pay for taking special training classes. While this sounds good, it changes the reason teachers want to improve. Instead of focusing on helping kids, teachers start thinking about the money. When money becomes the main reason to get better, teachers lose the passion for teaching that they had before.

#### The Testing Problem for Young Kids

Kindergarten students now have to take reading tests. The law says this helps find kids who need extra help, but the test scores are sent to the state and used to judge schools. What was supposed to be helpful testing turns into a way to control what happens in classrooms. Young kids feel pressure even before they start real school.

#### The Grant Money Trap

The state gives money to schools to help them plan longer school years. But this money really just helps schools get even more state money later. Schools become dependent on state funding instead of finding their own ways to help students. The state uses money to control what schools do.

#### The Illusion of Choice

Kids are "assigned" to special reading programs and have to go unless they are "specifically exempted." This makes it sound like schools care about each child's needs. But in reality, all kids are put into the same program, even if it doesn't work for them. Parents and teachers lose the power to decide what each child really needs.

#### The Hidden Costs of Free Tests

The state offers "free" reading tests to schools, so money wonâ€™t stop them from using them. But these "free" tests actually cost schools more in the end. Schools must spend time training teachers, filling out reports, and following new rules. The hidden costs are much higher than just buying their own tests.

#### The Core Issue

All of these rules make it seem like education is getting better. But they actually make things worse by taking away the freedom, teamwork, and local choices that help kids learn best. The state is taking control over decisions that parents, teachers, and local schools used to make together.

### Key List of Likely Negative Results 

#### The evaluation codes are based on these axioms:

- Central planning (one size fits all) degrades everyone's performance
  - Makes nearly every district action a legal matter
  - Robs people of pride in their work
  
- Efforts at 'accountability' will not improve performance of anyone

- Cooperation within an organization is far more effective than competition 

- All incentives work; some promote and some pervert the ***intention*** of the incentive
