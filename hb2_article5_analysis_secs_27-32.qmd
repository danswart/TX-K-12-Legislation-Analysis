## Opinionated Executive Summary: Control Through Complex Distribution Mechanisms

This law creates elaborate funding schemes that appear to support early education but actually increase state control over local decisions through complex distribution formulas and punitive mechanisms. Here are the main unintended results:


#### State Control Through Funding

The new funding rules for full-day prekindergarten give the state control over how districts use their resources. Schools must follow state-set rules instead of deciding what works best for their students.


#### Limited Choices for Literacy Programs

The Early Literacy Intervention funding helps pay for reading programs, but it forces schools to use state-approved methods. This limits schools from choosing the best reading programs for their students.  Good for publishers, bad for districts.


#### Third Grade Grants Will Punish Schools

The Third Grade Supplementary Supports rule says that if students who got grants still fail reading tests in third grade, the district loses future funding. This punishes schools for things they often don't control and blames teachers instead of addressesing those factors outside teacher control e.g., home environments, discipline, parent preference).  This may be the craziest section yet.


#### WAY Too Much Paperwork

The new rules require schools to track, report, and follow many complicated programs. Schools spend more time filling out forms instead of focusing on teaching. This adds a lot of extra work that takes away from helping students.  In the face of all this added bureaucracy, I don't know why anyone will still want to be a teacher.  Teaching is becoming a smaller and smaller part of what 'teachers' are expectd to do.


#### Detrimental Focus for Schools

Schools will have to start making decisions based on what brings in the most state money, not what helps students the most. The funding rules push schools to follow certain programs, even if they donâ€™t match the needs of local students or communities.


#### State Control Sneaking In Under the Guise of Support

These funding rules make schools follow state-approved methods. They give the illusion of more support but actually make schools more controlled by the state instead of being able to respond to local needs.


#### The Real Problem - Central Planning NEVER Improves Anything

These rules change early education funding from a system that schools can manage to one controlled by the state. They promise help but actually make schools more dependent on the state. The result is less control for local schools, more paperwork, and decisions based on rules instead of what students actually need.

### Key List of Likely Negative Results 

#### The evaluation codes are based on these axioms:

- Central planning (one size fits all) degrades everyone's performance
  - Makes nearly every district action a legal matter
  - Robs people of pride in their work
  
- Efforts at 'accountability' will not improve performance of anyone

- Cooperation within an organization is far more effective than competition 

- All incentives work; some promote and some pervert the ***intention*** of the incentive
