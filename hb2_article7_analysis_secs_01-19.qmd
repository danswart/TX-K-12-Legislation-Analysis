## Opinionated Executive Summary: Financial Control Replaces Local Authority

This law fundamentally restructures Texas public education finance to centralize control while creating the illusion of increased funding. Here are the main unintended results:


#### Facility Tracking System

Schools now have to report every square foot of every building, creating a large database of school facilities. This changes schools from local resources to state-monitored buildings. In the future, the state may require schools to use their buildings in certain ways.


#### Charter School Funding Rules

Charter schools get more money, but only if they meet strict financial rules and performance metrics. This creates a system where funding depends more on following state rules than on meeting the educational needs of students.  They should have relaxed the requirements on public schools to have parity between public and charter schools.  Instead (predictably) they chose to increase central planning on charters as well as public schools.


#### Commissioner Gains Power Over School Finances

The commissioner now has the power to change funding formulas without needing approval from lawmakers. This temporary power (expiring in 2027) sets a dangerous example for giving more control over school finances to the executive branch, bypassing the normal democratic process.  This is an outrageous power to give a political bureaucrat.



#### Small Schools Get Less

The extra funding for small districts may seem helpful, but it comes with conditions. The formulas make it hard for small schools to use the funding effectively, forcing them to change enrollment numbers just to meet the requirements, rather than focusing on improving education.


#### Language Programs Fight for Limited Resources

Language education programs have a statewide funding cap of $10 million, forcing schools to compete for limited money.  This will create competitionm for scarce resources.  Again, creating artificial scarcity.


#### Insurance Costs Create Regional Inequality

Coastal districts get extra funding to cover insurance costs, which creates a divide between coastal and inland areas. This favors some districts over others, based on where they are located.  Good for insurance carriers, bad for school districts.


### The Biggest Problem: Short-Term Thinking Replaces Long-Term

These changes may increase funding for some districts, but they take away the power schools have to decide how to spend that money. Districts will rely on state funding formulas that change every two years, making it impossible for schools to plan for the long term. The state decides who gets what money, when, and why.

### Key List of Likely Negative Results 

#### The evaluation codes are based on these axioms:

- Central planning (one size fits all) degrades everyone's performance
  - Makes nearly every district action a legal matter
  - Robs people of pride in their work
  
- Efforts at 'accountability' will not improve performance of anyone

- Cooperation within an organization is far more effective than competition 

- All incentives work; some promote and some pervert the ***intention*** of the incentive
