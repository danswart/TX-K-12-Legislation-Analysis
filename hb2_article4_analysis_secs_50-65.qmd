### Opinionated Executive Summary:  Good Intentions, Unintended Results

The rules in Article 4, Sections 4.50-4.65 reveal several issues that show how the law will produce disappointing results.


#### Funding Confusion

The new funding system seems like it will provide more money to help special education students. However, the system is so complicated that schools will spend more time filling out forms and sorting students into categories than actually helping them learn. What was supposed to be "help" becomes an extra burden.


#### Limited Choices for Parents

Parents are promised more control over their child's education through parent-directed service grants. But the state controls the options that parents can choose from. Instead of picking what their child really needs, parents are limited to options selected by the state. It’s like being told you can pick any color car you want, but only if it’s black.


#### Even More Data Overload

Schools are required to collect tons of data about students with dyslexia and other learning needs. While the law says this data will help provide better services, it actually takes up so much time that teachers have less time to help students directly. The effort spent on recording information ends up taking away from teaching.  Consider for one moment the enormous amounts of data that accumulate in state and federal government databases.


#### More Loss of Local Control (are you detecting a pattern yet?)

The law claims that regional programs will bring services closer to home. But these "local" programs must still follow state rules, use state money, and meet state standards. While services may be delivered locally, the decisions are made by state officials who don’t know the students, leaving local educators with little control over the services they provide.


#### The Expert Time Sink

The law puts more money into special education evaluations and expert services to make the field more professional. However, the rules and paperwork requirements are so heavy that experts spend more time on administrative tasks than using their skills to help students directly.


#### The Resource Drain

The law promises large increases in special education funding, but the cost of managing all the new rules and reports is very likely to eat up more money than schools actually get for helping students. What seems like extra funding might not go as far as it seems.


### The Core Problem

These issues show that the law doesn’t understand how school systems improve. Real progress in schools happens through good relationships, local knowledge, and the flexibility to alter policies to better meet students' needs. Instead, this law focuses on complicated funding systems and state control that will get in the way of actual improvement.

### Key List of Likely Negative Results 

#### The evaluation codes are based on these axioms:

- Central planning (one size fits all) degrades everyone's performance
  - Makes nearly every district action a legal matter
  - Robs people of pride in their work
  
- Efforts at 'accountability' will not improve performance of anyone

- Cooperation within an organization is far more effective than competition 

- All incentives work; some promote and some pervert the ***intention*** of the incentive
